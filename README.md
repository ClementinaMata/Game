# Game | Beep-beep

## Introduction

The first project was to make an entire game from scratch, the game is called "Beep-beep", and it's about a bee that wants to go to the bee hive, to do that the bee has to go through a labyrinth, but if the bee touches any of the lines or the borders of the game, you have to start all over again. Once the bee gets to the bee hive, the next level will start immediately, the difficulty of the game is more complex while increasing the level you are in.
